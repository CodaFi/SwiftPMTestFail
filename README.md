# SwiftPMTestFail

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodaFi/SwiftPMTestFail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodaFi/SwiftPMTestFail)

Demonstrates a build failure on Travis' Linux bots due to a change in Swift
5.1's copy of Swift Package Manager.  The failure seems to stem from a failure
to read package config files.
